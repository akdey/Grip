    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 27, 2026 (v1.2.0)</p>

    <div class="trusted-box">
        <strong>Trust &amp; Transparency:</strong> Grip Intelligence operates on a foundation of absolute transparency.
        We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. This is a non-commercial, personal tool;
        we do not use your personal information to train public AI models.
    </div>

    <h2>01. Data Collection &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p>We collect information necessary to provide financial analytics, including your email address for account
        identification and transaction data extracted from bank-related notifications.</p>

    <h2>02. Google User Data (Restricted Scope)</h2>
    <p>Grip accesses your Gmail account using OAuth 2.0 Restricted Scopes (gmail.readonly). We strictly search for and
        process only bank transaction notifications, credit card alerts, and financial statements.</p>

    <p><strong>How We Use This Data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically populate your financial dashboard with transaction details.</li>
        <li>Detect and categorize your spending across various bank accounts and cards.</li>
        <li>Extract investment confirmations to update your portfolio snapshots.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>AI Role &amp; Restrictions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Training:</strong> We do not use Google user data to train, retrain, or improve AI/ML models.
        </li>
        <li><strong>No Decisions:</strong> AI does not handle your financial calculations or money management logic.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Restricted Scope Compliance:</strong> Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to
        any other app will adhere to the <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data
            Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>03. Transaction Extraction Engine</h2>
    <p>Grip uses a <strong>two-stage, privacy-first extraction pipeline</strong> to process bank notification emails:
    </p>

    <div class="stage-box">
        <strong>Stage 1 &mdash; Local Rule Engine (Primary):</strong> Transaction details (amount, merchant, date) are
        extracted using a deterministic, in-process pattern-matching engine that runs entirely on our servers.
        No email content leaves our infrastructure during this stage. This handles &gt;90% of all transactions
        with zero external API calls, zero latency, and zero cost.
    </div>

    <div class="stage-box">
        <strong>Stage 2 &mdash; Groq AI (Fallback Only):</strong> For emails the rule engine cannot confidently parse,
        a <em>sanitized and anonymized</em> snippet is sent to Groq's external API.
        <strong>All PAN, Aadhaar, card numbers, UPI IDs, and phone numbers are masked before any data leaves our
            servers.</strong> Groq is used strictly as a last resort, not the default processing path.
    </div>

    <h2>04. Financial Intelligence Engine</h2>
    <p>Our logic-based intelligence engine performs rigorous financial calculations to provide variance analysis and
        "Safe to Spend" metrics. Safe-to-Spend is a deterministic mathematical calculation based on your current
        balance minus unpaid bills and projected recurring commitments. It includes a safety buffer based on your
        actual 30-day discretionary spending averages.</p>

    <h2>05. Privacy Shield &amp; Sanitization</h2>
    <p>We implement <strong>Privacy-by-Design</strong> via a local sanitization layer that operates <u>before</u> any
        data is processed by our extraction engines or sent to any external service. Our system automatically detects
        and masks highly sensitive fields including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full Credit/Debit Card numbers (Masked to &lt;CARD&gt;)</li>
        <li>Personal Phone numbers and Emails</li>
        <li>Bank Account numbers and UPI IDs</li>
        <li>National IDs (PAN, Aadhaar)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This ensures that even during fallback external processing, your most sensitive identifiers are never exposed
        in raw format.</p>

    <h2>06. Security</h2>
    <p>We use TLS encryption for data in transit and industry-standard AES-256 encryption at rest for sensitive
        financial markers. Passwords utilize salted cryptographic hashing.</p>
