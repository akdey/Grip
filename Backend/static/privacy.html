    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 25, 2026 (v1.0.1)</p>

    <div class="trusted-box">
        <strong>Trust & Transparency:</strong> Grip Intelligence operates on a foundation of absolute transparency.
        We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. This is a non-commercial, personal tool;
        we do not use your personal information to train public AI models.
    </div>

    <h2>01. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>We collect information necessary to provide financial analytics, including your email address for account
        identification and transaction data extracted from bank-related notifications.</p>

    <h2>02. Google User Data (Restricted Scope)</h2>
    <p>Grip accesses your Gmail account using OAuth 2.0 Restricted Scopes (gmail.readonly). We strictly search for and
        process
        only bank transaction notifications, credit card alerts, and financial statements.</p>

    <p><strong>How We Use This Data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically populate your financial dashboard with transaction details.</li>
        <li>Detect and categorize your spending across various bank accounts and cards.</li>
        <li>Extract investment confirmations to update your portfolio snapshots.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>AI Role (Data Extraction Only):</strong> We use Large Language Models (LLMs) strictly for the structural
        extraction of transaction data from raw email text. <u>AI does not handle your financial calculations or money
            management logic.</u></p>

    <p><strong>Restricted Scope Compliance:</strong> Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to
        any other app will adhere to the <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data
            Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>03. Financial Intelligence Engine</h2>
    <p>Our logic-based intelligence engine performs rigorous financial calculations to provide variance analysis and
        "Safe to Spend" metrics.
        Safe-to-Spend is a deterministic mathematical calculation based on your current balance minus unpaid bills and
        projected recurring commitments.
        It includes a safety buffer based on your actual 30-day discretionary spending averages.</p>

    <h2>04. Privacy Sanitization & Governance</h2>
    <p>All processing is containerized and scoped strictly to your unique account ID. We use local regex-based
        sanitization tools to mask
        highly sensitive PII (like full account numbers or UPI IDs) <u>before</u> any extraction or analysis occurs.</p>

    <h2>05. Security</h2>
    <p>We use TLS encryption for data in transit and industry-standard AES-256 encryption at rest for sensitive
        financial markers.
        Passwords utilize salted cryptographic hashing.</p>
