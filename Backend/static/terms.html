    <div class="alert">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Grip is an analytics tool, not a financial advisor. Use this data for informational
        purposes only.
    </div>

    <h2>01. Service Description</h2>
    <p>Grip Intelligence provides a personal financial dashboard that aggregates bank transaction data via automated
        email syncing. The system uses a hybrid extraction pipeline: a local rule-based engine for primary extraction,
        with Groq AI as a fallback for ambiguous emails. All data is sanitized before any external processing.</p>

    <h2>02. Data Access &amp; Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Gmail sync feature, you grant Grip a limited license to read transaction-related emails. You can
        revoke this consent at any time via your Google Account security settings. Grip will only access emails that
        match financial alert patterns (debit/credit alerts, bank notifications). Marketing and promotional emails
        are filtered out automatically.</p>

    <h2>03. External AI Services</h2>
    <p>Grip may send anonymized, PII-sanitized email snippets to Groq's API as a fallback when the local extraction
        engine is unable to parse a transaction. By using Grip, you consent to this limited, sanitized data transfer.
        No raw personal identifiers (card numbers, PAN, Aadhaar, UPI IDs) are ever sent to external services.</p>

    <h2>04. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You may not use Grip for any illegal financial activities or attempt to reverse-engineer our proprietary
        Intelligence Engine.</p>

    <h2>05. Liability</h2>
    <p>Grip is provided "as-is." We are not responsible for financial decisions made based on the projections or "Safe
        to Spend" metrics provided by the tool. Transaction extraction accuracy depends on the format of your bank's
        notification emails and may not be 100% accurate in all cases.</p>

    <h2>06. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions regarding these terms, contact amitkr.dey1998@gmail.com</p>
