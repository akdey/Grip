## 🌟 What Makes Grip Different

### 💰 Know Your True Spending Power
- **Safe-to-Spend Engine**: See what you can *actually* spend after bills, credit cards, and commitments—not just your bank balance.
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Automatically accounts for unpaid bills, upcoming rent, and unbilled credit card purchases.
- **Predictive Budgeting**: Includes projected recurring expenses ("Surety") before they even arrive.

### 🎯 Timing Alpha: The Only Platform for Precision Wealth Analytics
Most investment apps are "lazy"—they show you generic fund returns or XIRR calculated with approximate dates. Grip is built for the precision-obsessed investor.

**The "Average" Problem with Other Platforms:**
- ❌ **Lazy Pricing**: Use month-end NAVs or weekly averages to calculate your returns.
- ❌ **Generic XIRR**: Show you a number that assumes your transactions happened at a "standard" time.
- ❌ **The Blind Spot**: No insight into whether your SIP date is actually helping or hurting you.

**The Grip Precision Advantage:**
- ✅ **Day-Specific NAV**: We fetch the *exact* NAV of the day your transaction hit the bank. If you invest on the 7th, we calculate parity with the 7th, not a "monthly average".
- ✅ **Timing Leakage Analysis (WORLD FIRST)**: We analyze every SIP you've ever made and cross-reference them with the volatility schedules of that specific fund. 
- ✅ **What-If Date Simulation**: Grip simulates your entire investment history against every other day of the month (1st to 28th) to determine if a simple change in your salary-cycle could yield an extra 1-2% in "Timing Alpha".

**Why this is a Big Deal:**
Mutual Fund NAVs fluctuates daily. An investor who does a SIP on the 10th vs. the 15th might see a **1.5% difference in lifetime XIRR** for the exact same fund. Most platforms hide this "Timing Leakage." Grip exposes it and shows you how to fix it.

> **Our Finding says:** No other retail investment platform in India—not Zerodha Coin, INDMoney, or Groww—performs historical date-permutation analysis on your *actual* transactions to optimize your future returns.

### 🛡️ Frictionless, Private Onboarding
While others make you wait for "syncs" or manual entries, Grip is built to get you from zero to "Deep Insights" in under a minute.

- **Universal Statement Import**: Upload your Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) from CAMS, KFin, or MFCentral. We reconstruct your entire investment life—identifying SIPs, step-ups, and even "missed" months—instantly.
- **Step-Up & Skip Detection**: We don't just show total units; we map the *evolution* of your discipline. See exactly when you increased your SIPs and where you missed a beat.
- **Privacy-First Intelligence**: All your data is processed with local sanitization. Your bank details and PAN are masked *before* our analysis engines ever touch the data.

### 📊 Professional-Grade Portfolio Simulation
- **AI-Powered Forecasting**: We use Facebook Prophet (the same engine used by data scientists for revenue forecasting) to project your portfolio 10-20 years into the future with realistic confidence intervals.
- **Simulation Mode**: Instantly see how a ₹2,000 "Step-Up" in your monthly SIP today changes your net worth 15 years from now.
- **Email-to-Wealth Pipeline**: Once imported, Grip auto-extracts your future buys from your bank alert emails. No more manual tracking.
- **Precision XIRR**: Calculated using the Newton-Raphson method for accurate annualized returns based on daily cashflows.
- **Timing Leakage Reports**: Detailed breakdown of how much "extra" money you could have made by simply shifting your SIP date.

### 🤖 Hybrid Intelligence — Fast, Private, Reliable
- **Local LLM Engine (Primary)**: A high-privacy, zero-cost LLM (SmolLM2-1.7B) runs natively on your server for extraction. No external API calls needed.
- **Rule Engine (Secondary)**: A deterministic, zero-latency pattern-matching engine handles common Indian bank email formats.
- **Automatic Transaction Extraction**: Connect Gmail once; transactions are extracted from bank alerts automatically.
- **Webhook Sync Optimization**: Intelligent 5-second debouncing and concurrency guards prevent redundant syncs from batch emails.
- **Autonomous Notification Engine**: Scheduled email alerts for Gmail disconnection, surety bill reminders, and spending insights.
- **Hybrid Forecasting**: Combines Meta Prophet (statistical) + Local LLM (contextual) to predict month-end expenses.
- **Smart Learning**: Remembers your merchant preferences, auto-categorizes future transactions.
- **Multi-Layer Spam Filter**: Sender whitelist + subject gates + body signals distinguish real transactions from marketing emails.
### 🔒 Privacy Built-In, Not Bolted-On
- **100% On-Server Extraction**: Local LLM (SmolLM2-1.7B) runs natively on our server. Your financial data **never leaves your infrastructure** for extraction.
- **Real-Time Privacy**: Gmail webhooks (via Google Pub/Sub) trigger immediate, secure parsing.
- **Sanitization Before Processing**: PAN, Aadhaar, and Credit Card numbers are masked *before* the LLM even sees them, providing double-layered privacy.
- **No Data Selling**: Your financial data stays yours. Period.
- **Self-Hostable**: Open architecture—you control the deployment and data.
- **Read-Only Gmail**: OAuth 2.0 with minimal scopes; we can't send or modify your emails.

---

## ⚡ Zero-Effort Automation
- **One-Click Sync**: Connect Gmail → Transactions flow in automatically
- **Smart Deduplication**: SHA-256 hashing ensures no duplicate transactions
- **Background Processing**: Email parsing happens async—never blocks your UI
- **Merchant Intelligence**: Auto-learns from your verifications, gets smarter over time
- **Daily Price Sync**: Scheduled job updates investment NAVs every evening at 9 PM IST

## ✨ Key Features

### 💰 Safe-to-Spend Intelligence (Core USP)

**The Number That Matters Most**

Forget checking your bank balance—Grip shows you what you can *actually* spend without stress.

**Intelligent Calculation:**
```
Safe-to-Spend = Current Balance 
                - Unpaid Bills
                - Projected Recurring Bills (Surety)
                - Current Unbilled Credit Card Expenses
                - Configurable Safety Buffer (default 10%)
```

**Real-World Example:**
```
Bank Balance:              ₹45,000
- Rent (due in 5 days):    -₹15,000
- Utilities (projected):    -₹2,500
- Unbilled CC purchases:    -₹8,200
- Safety Buffer (10%):      -₹1,930
─────────────────────────────────────
Safe-to-Spend:             ₹17,370 ✅
```

**Visual Health System:**
- 🔴 **Negative**: Overdrawn (immediate action required)
- 🟠 **Critical**: < ₹1,000 (extremely tight budget)
- 🟡 **Warning**: ₹1,000 - ₹3,000 (limited spending room)
- 🟢 **Healthy**: > ₹3,000 (comfortable spending capacity)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents Overspending**: Accounts for committed expenses before they hit
- **Reduces Anxiety**: One number tells you your true spending power
- **Builds Buffer**: Automatic safety margin prevents living paycheck-to-paycheck
- **Predictive**: Includes projected bills, not just current ones

- Tracks: Card name, last 4 digits, statement date, payment due date, credit limit
- Automatic billing cycle calculation (current cycle, days remaining)
- Real-time unbilled amount in current cycle
- Credit utilization monitoring (% of limit used)

**Billing Cycle Intelligence**
```
HDFC Regalia Gold (••1234)
───────────────────────────────────
Statement Date:    15th (every month)
Payment Due:       25th (every month)
Current Cycle:     Jan 16 - Feb 15
Days to Statement: 12 days
───────────────────────────────────
Unbilled Amount:   ₹8,247
Credit Limit:      ₹3,00,000
Utilization:       2.7% ✅
```

**Smart Alerts & Predictions**
- "Cycle closes in 5 days: ₹8,247 unbilled"
- "Estimated bill: ₹8,500 (based on current trend)"
- "Payment due in 10 days: ₹12,340"
- Prevents surprise bills by tracking unbilled amounts in real-time

**Transaction Linking**

### 📋 Bill Management & "Surety" Intelligence

**Bill Tracking**
- Create one-time or recurring bills
- Set due dates and payment amounts
- Mark bills as paid/unpaid
- View upcoming bills (next 7/30/60 days)
- Payment reminders

**Surety Bills (Predictable Expenses)**

The secret sauce for accurate Safe-to-Spend calculation.

**What is "Surety"?**
Predictable, recurring expenses that you *know* are coming:
- Rent (every 1st of month)
- Electricity/Water (monthly)
- Internet/Phone bills
- Insurance premiums
- Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Society maintenance

**How It Works:**
```
① Mark bill as "Surety" (predictable recurring)
② Grip automatically projects next occurrence
③ Amount included in Safe-to-Spend calculation
④ Even if not yet billed, it's accounted for
```

**Example:**
```
Rent: ₹15,000 (Surety, due 1st of every month)
Today: Jan 20
Next Due: Feb 1 (12 days away)

Safe-to-Spend: Already reduced by ₹15,000
Result: Prevents overspending before rent is due ✅
```

**Frozen Funds Breakdown:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Frozen Funds: ₹25,700                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Unpaid Bills:           ₹10,500      │
│ • Projected Surety:       ₹12,000      │
│ • Unbilled CC:             ₹3,200      │

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Vercel (Free, unlimited bandwidth)
- **Backend**: Railway (Serverless, $5/month credit)
- **Database**: Supabase (Free tier, 500MB)
- **Scheduled Tasks**: GitHub Actions (Free unlimited for public repos)

**Total Cost: $0/month** (everything within free tiers!)

---

### Backend Deployment (Railway)

#### 1. Initial Setup

1. **Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)** with GitHub
2. **Create New Project** → Deploy from GitHub repo
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Configure Service:**
   - Root Directory: `Backend`
   - Start Command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Watch Paths: `Backend/**`

#### 2. Environment Variables

Add these in Railway Dashboard → Variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
GRIP_SECRET=webhook-secret
ENVIRONMENT=production

# AI
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
USE_AI_FORECASTING=true
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false  # Using GitHub Actions for scheduled tasks

# Gmail OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Email (OTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@grip.com
FROM_NAME=Grip

# Branding
APP_NAME=Grip
APP_TAGLINE=Money that minds itself.
```

#### 3. Generate Domain

- Go to Settings → Generate Domain
- Copy the URL (e.g., `https://grip-backend.up.railway.app`)
- Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in frontend

---

### Scheduled Tasks (GitHub Actions)

**Why GitHub Actions?**
- ✅ **Free unlimited** for public repos (2,000 min/month for private)
- ✅ Saves $1-2/month on Railway (serverless vs always-on)
- ✅ Reliable cron scheduling
- ✅ Easy monitoring via1. **Add Secrets** (One-time):
   - Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret" and add:
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Supabase connection string.
     - `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`: For email alerts.
     - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: For Gmail OAuth.
     - `GROQ_API_KEY`: For AI transaction extraction.
     - `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`: Your deployment URL (e.g. `https://grip.vercel.app`).

2. **Workflows are already configured**:
   - `daily-price-sync.yml`: Runs at 3:30 PM IST (Price updates).
   - `gmail_sync.yml`: Runs every hour (Transactions).
   - `daily-intelligence.yml`: Runs at 9:00 AM IST (Reminders & Insights).

3. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click "Daily Price Sync"
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
   - Check logs to verify success

4. **Set Railway to Serverless**:
   - In Railway Environment Variables:
   - `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false` (disables internal scheduler)
   - This saves ~$1-2/month in Railway credits

**Monitoring:**
- View logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Check Railway logs for API requests
- Verify data updates in Supabase dashboard

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Handling

### What We Store
- Transaction metadata (amount, merchant, category, dates)
- Investment snapshots (units, prices, dates)
- Encrypted OAuth tokens (Gmail access)
- User preferences and mappings
- Sync logs (for debugging)

### What We DON'T Store
- Full email content
- Credit card CVVs or PINs
- Unmasked PAN/Aadhaar numbers
- Gmail passwords
- Any sensitive PII

### Data Flow
1. Email received in your Gmail
2. OAuth token grants read access
3. Email content fetched via API
4. **Sanitization happens locally** (regex masking)
5. Sanitized text sent to Groq for extraction
6. Extracted JSON stored in database
7. Investment transactions auto-mapped to holdings
8. Daily price sync updates portfolio values
9. Original email remains in your Gmail (unchanged)

## 🛠️ Environment & Security Configuration

Grip is designed with a "Privacy-First" and "Cloud-Resilient" architecture. Depending on where you deploy (Local vs. Cloud), you may need to adjust certain security measures:

### 📧 Email Connection Modes
Most cloud providers (Hugging Face, Railway) block **Ports 25, 587, and 465** to prevent spam. 
- **Grip Email Relay (Microservice)**: By default, we use a dedicated relay service (located in `/EmailService`) intended for deployment on Vercel (Port 443) to bypass SMTP blocks. Configure `EMAIL_RELAY_URL` in your `.env`.
- **Standard SMTP**: If running locally or on a VPS where ports are open, uncomment the `LEGACY DIRECT SMTP` block in `app/core/email.py` and set your Gmail App Password.

### 🤖 LLM Intelligence & Fallbacks
We utilize a dual-track AI system for maximum reliability:
- **Grip Intelligence (Primary)**: A high-performance, private engine hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Groq Llama-3 (Roboust Fallback)**: If the primary engine is sleeping or unreachable, Grip automatically falls back to Groq.
- **Note**: Ensure `GROQ_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables. If you wish to use only Groq, uncomment the relevant lines in `app/core/llm.py`.

### 🔐 Security Measures
- **Sanitization First**: All PII (PAN, Account numbers) is masked via local regex logic *before* being processed by any AI engine.
- **Scoped Ingress**: Gmail OAuth is restricted to `gmail.readonly` and specifically queries for transaction-only keywords.
